Course Online Textbook

All course materials can be downloaded from Repositories > Select Repository > Code > Download ZIP or can be cloned into an your Azure Virtual Machine.

For the purpose of this course, we will be using Azure Virtual Machines which I have already configured with the correct conda environment for our purposes. To run the course outside of an Azure VM, the ees3506_5506 conda environment used can be set up with the .yml located here. This assumes one has miniconda & mamba already installed on their system, if not, follow the instructions here for your specific configuration.
